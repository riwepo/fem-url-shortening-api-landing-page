## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I realised I forgot to change to application title on all my previous challengesðŸ˜².

I learned how to split the background colour vertically into two, using a gradient.

I learned more about flex box.
When used in column direction, because we have 'unlimited' vertical space, justify-content: space-around or space-between won't work unless you give the container a fixed height.
It is easier to put margins on each item and let the container adapt itself.

I learned how to set background image through css, center it, don't repeat, set size etc.

### Continued development

I feel I could have managed the alignment of the content in a simpler way with better use of containing divs.

## Acknowledgments

I looked at this project to get started.
I wasn't sure if there were multiple pages, if the menus were meant to work, etc.
